**A simple application to manage pub's inventory and to make orders simplier!**

## What's the point?

When it's time to make some new orders and manage pub's inventory it can become a long and hard procces. A person chareged to do this work has to check the aviability of all products in all stocks situated on different levels of the pub, write down every single product (name, price per kg/ct/unit, supplier ecc) that should be ordered to the organizer. After all pproducts were added to the organizer it's time to send email to each supplier! So it require a quite long time to find the right product for each supplier in organizer, add it to message that should be sended, and then add every product to the Google Sheet file and get some statistics about orders using different formulas... A really long process!

## So what's the solution?

The proposal is to degitalize this task and make it faster and simplier! Application alows you to manage all products situated in database (Firebase Firestore in this case), add new suppliers, make new orders by simply clicking one button and store every order in database!
